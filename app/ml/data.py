# Interview questions per role
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
INTERVIEW_QUESTIONS = {
    "Python Developer": [
        {"q": "What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?",
         "a": "Lists are mutable (changeable) and use square brackets []. Tuples are immutable (cannot be changed) and use parentheses (). Tuples are faster and used for fixed data."},
        {"q": "What is a decorator in Python?",
         "a": "A decorator is a function that wraps another function to add extra behaviour without modifying it. It uses the @decorator syntax above a function definition."},
        {"q": "Explain the difference between `is` and `==`.",
         "a": "`==` checks if two values are equal. `is` checks if two variables point to the exact same object in memory."},
        {"q": "What is a virtual environment and why do we use it?",
         "a": "A virtual environment is an isolated Python installation for a specific project. It lets each project have its own dependencies without conflicts."},
        {"q": "What is the difference between Django and Flask?",
         "a": "Django is a full-featured framework with ORM, admin panel, and auth built-in (batteries included). Flask is a micro-framework — lightweight, with only the essentials, and you add what you need."},
    ],
    "Data Science": [
        {"q": "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
         "a": "Supervised learning trains on labelled data (input + correct output). Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data that has no labels."},
        {"q": "What is overfitting and how do you prevent it?",
         "a": "Overfitting is when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new data. We prevent it with techniques like cross-validation, regularization, and using more training data."},
        {"q": "What is TF-IDF?",
         "a": "TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a technique to convert text into numbers. Words that appear often in one document but rarely in others get a high score, making them more meaningful."},
        {"q": "Explain the bias-variance tradeoff.",
         "a": "High bias = model is too simple (underfits). High variance = model is too complex (overfits). The goal is to find the sweet spot with low bias and low variance."},
        {"q": "What is a confusion matrix?",
         "a": "A table that shows how many predictions were correct (True Positives/Negatives) and incorrect (False Positives/Negatives). It helps evaluate a classification model's performance."},
    ],
    "Web Designing": [
        {"q": "What is the CSS Box Model?",
         "a": "Every HTML element is a box with four layers: Content → Padding → Border → Margin. Understanding this is key to controlling spacing and layout."},
        {"q": "What is responsive web design?",
         "a": "Designing websites that look good on all screen sizes using techniques like media queries, flexible grids, and fluid images."},
        {"q": "What is the difference between Flexbox and CSS Grid?",
         "a": "Flexbox is one-dimensional (row OR column). CSS Grid is two-dimensional (rows AND columns). Use Flexbox for components; use Grid for full page layouts."},
        {"q": "What is a wireframe?",
         "a": "A wireframe is a simple black-and-white sketch of a web page's layout — no colors or graphics. It focuses on structure and user flow before visual design begins."},
        {"q": "What is UI vs UX?",
         "a": "UI (User Interface) is how it looks — colors, fonts, buttons. UX (User Experience) is how it works — the journey a user takes to complete a task."},
    ],
    "Java Developer": [
        {"q": "What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?",
         "a": "JVM (Java Virtual Machine) runs bytecode. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) = JVM + libraries. JDK (Java Development Kit) = JRE + compiler + tools to write Java."},
        {"q": "What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?",
         "a": "An interface defines a contract (what to do, not how). An abstract class can have some implemented methods. A class can implement multiple interfaces but extend only one abstract class."},
        {"q": "What is Spring Boot?",
         "a": "Spring Boot is a framework that makes it easy to build production-ready Spring applications. It handles configuration automatically so you can focus on business logic."},
        {"q": "What is a NullPointerException and how do you avoid it?",
         "a": "A NullPointerException happens when you try to use a variable that is null. Avoid it by using null checks, Optional, or initializing variables properly."},
        {"q": "Explain the concept of multithreading in Java.",
         "a": "Multithreading allows a program to run multiple threads simultaneously, improving performance. Threads share the same memory, so we use synchronization to avoid conflicts."},
    ],
    "DevOps Engineer": [
        {"q": "What is the difference between containerization and virtualization?",
         "a": "Virtualization creates a full virtual machine with its own OS. Containerization (Docker) shares the host OS kernel — containers are lighter and start faster."},
        {"q": "What is CI/CD?",
         "a": "CI (Continuous Integration) = automatically build and test code after every commit. CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) = automatically deploy the tested code to production or staging."},
        {"q": "What is Kubernetes and why is it used?",
         "a": "Kubernetes (K8s) is a system for managing Docker containers at scale — it handles deployment, scaling, and self-healing (restarting failed containers)."},
        {"q": "What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?",
         "a": "Managing and provisioning infrastructure (servers, networks) using code files instead of manual processes. Terraform and Ansible are common IaC tools."},
        {"q": "What is the purpose of a load balancer?",
         "a": "A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers so no single server is overwhelmed, improving performance and fault tolerance."},
    ],
    "Testing": [
        {"q": "What is the difference between functional and non-functional testing?",
         "a": "Functional testing checks what the system does (does the login work?). Non-functional testing checks how it performs (how fast? how secure?)."},
        {"q": "What is regression testing?",
         "a": "Re-running previously passed test cases after a code change to ensure the new change didn't break anything that worked before."},
        {"q": "What is a test plan?",
         "a": "A document that outlines the scope, objectives, approach, resources, and schedule for testing. It's the roadmap for the entire testing process."},
        {"q": "What is the difference between black-box and white-box testing?",
         "a": "Black-box: tester doesn't know the internal code — tests from user's perspective. White-box: tester knows the code and tests internal logic/paths."},
        {"q": "What is a bug life cycle?",
         "a": "The stages a bug goes through: New → Assigned → Open → Fixed → Retest → Closed (or Reopened if the fix didn't work)."},
    ],
    "HR": [
        {"q": "What is the full cycle of recruitment?",
         "a": "Job analysis → Job posting → Sourcing candidates → Screening → Interviews → Selection → Offer → Onboarding."},
        {"q": "How do you handle a conflict between two employees?",
         "a": "Listen to both sides privately, identify the root cause, mediate a discussion, agree on a resolution, document it, and follow up."},
        {"q": "What is attrition and how do you reduce it?",
         "a": "Attrition is the rate at which employees leave the company. Reduce it through competitive salaries, career growth, recognition, good work culture, and regular feedback."},
        {"q": "What is an HRIS?",
         "a": "Human Resource Information System — software used to manage employee data, payroll, attendance, benefits, and recruitment in one place."},
        {"q": "What is the difference between training and development?",
         "a": "Training is short-term, job-specific skill building (e.g., how to use a tool). Development is long-term growth for future roles (e.g., leadership skills)."},
    ],
    "Business Analyst": [
        {"q": "What is a BRD?",
         "a": "Business Requirements Document — a formal document that describes what a business needs from a system or process. It is the foundation for development."},
        {"q": "What is the difference between a use case and a user story?",
         "a": "A use case describes all interactions between a user and a system in detail. A user story is a short, simple description from the user's perspective: 'As a user, I want to... so that...'"},
        {"q": "What is gap analysis?",
         "a": "Comparing the current state (what we have) vs the desired state (what we need) to identify the gaps that need to be addressed."},
        {"q": "What tools do Business Analysts commonly use?",
         "a": "Jira, Confluence (documentation), Visio/Lucidchart (process mapping), SQL (data queries), Excel/Google Sheets, and Power BI/Tableau for data visualization."},
        {"q": "How do you handle changing requirements?",
         "a": "Document the change request, assess its impact on scope/timeline/cost, get stakeholder approval, update relevant documents, and communicate the change to the team."},
    ],
    "Sales": [
        {"q": "What is the sales funnel?",
         "a": "A model showing the stages a customer goes through: Awareness → Interest → Consideration → Intent → Purchase → Loyalty. Each stage has fewer prospects than the one above."},
        {"q": "What is the difference between B2B and B2C sales?",
         "a": "B2B (Business to Business) involves longer sales cycles, multiple decision-makers, and larger deal sizes. B2C (Business to Consumer) has shorter cycles and emotional buying triggers."},
        {"q": "How do you handle a customer objection?",
         "a": "Listen, acknowledge the concern, ask clarifying questions, address it with facts/value, and confirm the resolution. Never argue."},
        {"q": "What is CRM and why is it important?",
         "a": "Customer Relationship Management — software to track interactions with customers. It helps manage pipelines, follow-ups, and sales history in one place."},
        {"q": "What metrics do you track in sales?",
         "a": "Revenue, conversion rate, average deal size, customer acquisition cost, customer lifetime value, churn rate, and monthly/quarterly quota attainment."},
    ],
    "Network Security Engineer": [
        {"q": "What is the difference between IDS and IPS?",
         "a": "IDS (Intrusion Detection System) detects and alerts on suspicious activity. IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) detects AND automatically blocks the threat."},
        {"q": "What is a firewall and how does it work?",
         "a": "A firewall monitors and controls incoming/outgoing network traffic based on security rules. It creates a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external ones."},
        {"q": "What is penetration testing?",
         "a": "Ethical hacking — deliberately attacking a system with permission to find vulnerabilities before malicious hackers do."},
        {"q": "What is the CIA triad?",
         "a": "The three core principles of security: Confidentiality (only authorized access), Integrity (data is accurate and unmodified), Availability (systems are accessible when needed)."},
        {"q": "What is SSL/TLS?",
         "a": "SSL/TLS are protocols that encrypt data transmitted over a network (e.g., HTTPS). TLS is the modern, more secure version of SSL."},
